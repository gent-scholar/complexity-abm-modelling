# complexity-modelling
First steps to learn complexity modelling approaches in economics with Python on my own.
I am building on Claudius Gr√§bner's course for ABMs (Agent-based models) https://claudius-graebner.com/teaching/introduction-abm-deutsch.html and https://www.youtube.com/c/blablabla2189, extending it myself, particularly the technological choice model.
